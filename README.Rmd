This package extends ggplot2 by providing advanced tools for aligning and
organizing multiple plots, particularly those that automatically reorder
observations, such as dendrogram. It offers fine control over layout adjustment
and plot annotations, enabling you to create complex, publication-quality
visualizations while still using the familiar grammar of ggplot2. 

## Why use `ggalign`?
`ggalign` focuses on aligning observations across multiple plots. It leverages
the `"number of observations"` in the
[vctrs](https://vctrs.r-lib.org/reference/vec_size.html) package or `NROW()`
function to maintain consistency in plot organization. 

If you've ever struggled with aligning plots with self-contained ordering (like
dendrogram), or applying consistent grouping or ordering across multiple plots
(e.g., with k-means clustering), `ggalign` is designed to make this easier. The
package integrates seamlessly with ggplot2, providing the flexibility to use its
geoms, scales, and other components for complex visualizations. 

## Installation

You can install `ggalign` from `CRAN` using:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggalign")
```

Alternatively, install the development version from
[r-universe](https://yunuuuu.r-universe.dev/ggalign) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggalign",
    repos = c("https://yunuuuu.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```

or from [GitHub](https://github.com/Yunuuuu/ggalign) with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Yunuuuu/ggalign")
```

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the contributors of the
`ggplot2` project for providing a powerful and flexible framework for data
visualization in R. Their work laid the foundation for the functionality and
design of this package. I would also like to thank the `patchwork` project, from
which the core coding for the plot composer was adapted. The `patchwork` library
provided a useful mechanism for combining and aligning plots, which was modified
to suit the needs of this package. Without the contributions of these
open-source projects, this package would not have been possible.

Additionally, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to @teunbrand, who has
fulfilled my numerous feature requests, and assisted with the integration of new
functions into ggplot2.
