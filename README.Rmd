## Installation

You can install the development version of `ggalign` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Yunuuuu/ggalign")
```

This package now depends on some un-merged characteristics of patchwork. Please
see <https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork/pull/373>. If you want to try it,
you should install patchwork with
`pak::pkg_install(Yunuuuu/patchwork@align_axis_title)`.

The documentation for `ggalign` is currently in progress.

```{r child = "vignettes/Introduction.Rmd"}
