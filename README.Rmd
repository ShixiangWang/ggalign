# ggalign
This package extends ggplot2 and offers several benefits for organizing and
arranging plots. It is specifically designed to align the axes of multiple
ggplot objects consistently. This functionality is particularly useful for plots
where data order needs to be manipulated. One common application of this package
is in effectively organizing combinations of plots, such as a dendrogram and a
heatmap.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `ggalign` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Yunuuuu/ggalign")
```

This package now depends on some un-merged features of patchwork. Please see
<https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork/pull/373>. If you want to try it, you
should install patchwork with
`pak::pkg_install(Yunuuuu/patchwork@align_axis_title)`.

The documentation for `ggalign` is currently in progress.

## Features
`ggalign` pacakge provides two layout to arrange ggplot objects:

  - `layout_heatmap()`/`ggheamtap()`: Arrange ggplot into a Heatmap layout. See
  `vignette("layout-heatmap")` for details.

  - `layout_stack()`/`ggstack()`: Arrange ggplot vertically or horizontally. See
  `vignette("layout-stack")` for details.

To further customize these layouts, the `ggalign` package offers several `Align`
objects: 

  - `align_group()`: Group layout axis into panel with a group variable.
  - `align_kmeans()`: Group layout axis into panel by kmeans
  - `align_reorder()`: Reorders layout observations based on weights or summary
  statistics. 
  - `align_dendro()`: Reorder or Group layout based on hierarchical clustering

For more detailed instructions on customizing layouts, see the vignette:
`vignette("align-layout")`. 

Additionally, the following `Align` objects can be used to add plots directly
into the layout: 

  - `align_gg()`/`ggalign()`: Create ggplot object with a customized data.
  - `align_panel()`/`ggpanel()`: Create ggplot object with the layout panel
    data.

For more information on adding plots, refer to the vignette:
`vignette("align-plot")`.
