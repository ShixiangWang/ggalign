  desc: >
    All plots begin with a call to `ggheatmap()` or `ggstack()`, supplying default 
    data. You then reorder the layout, or group the layout into panels, and add 
    plots, layers, scales, coords with `+`. Use `hmanno()` or `stack_active()` to 
    control the layout attributes. To save a plot to disk, use `ggsave()`.

    This section covers essential functions to add individual plots to the layout, 
    ensuring they align and interact correctly within the defined structure.

- title: Layout Customization
  desc: >
    Fine-tune the arrangement of plots by reordering or splitting axes into separate panels. 
    These functions allow for more detailed customization of plot layouts.

- title: Plot composer
  desc: >
    This section outlines essential functions for composing plots into a grid,
    intended for internal use. The core code is derived from the `patchwork`
    package, with the hope of eventually integrating and merging these functions
    into the `patchwork` project.
