    All plots begin with a call to `ggheatmap()` or `ggstack()`, supplying default 
    data and aesthetic mappings, specified by `aes()`. You then reorder the layout, 
    or group the layout into panels, and add plots, layers, scales, coords with `+`. 
    To save a plot to disk, use `ggsave()`.

    This section outlines essential functions for composing plots into a grid,
    intended for internal use. The core code is derived from the `patchwork`
    package, with the hope of eventually integrating and merging these functions
    into the `patchwork` project.
